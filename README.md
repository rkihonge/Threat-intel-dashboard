# Threat Intelligence Dashboard

This is a simple threat intelligence dashboard built with **Streamlit** and **Pandas**.  
It loads sample threat data (IPs, domains, CVEs) and visualizes them for security analysis.  

## Features
- Load threat intel data from CSV
- Display tables of malicious indicators (IPs, domains, CVEs)
- Show charts of top threats by category
- Export filtered data to CSV
- Easy to extend with real APIs (AlienVault OTX, AbuseIPDB, etc.)
